# Basic-Portfolio
### This is my first experiment with coding a website.

#### Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS

This is the First Portfolio I built when I first started coding, it is very basic and is not responsive. It was written by me in January 2018 and I never added media queries, but I built it from the ground up using only html and css, no libraries or frameworks.
